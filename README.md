# Iphone Calculator 

Flutter project trying to simulate the iphone calculator on android.

## Getting Started

The project tries to simulate the iphone calculator on android devices, using the flutter mobile app framework.
I also added some other features like an InMemory history of calculations.

## To-Dos

- Add decimal point and logic to manage decimal point calculations.
- Use SQLite to store calculations history
